  <tr>
    <td>Starting point:</td>
    <td>I started off by getting everything i needed plus my new piece of equipment the robot arm.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Target for this lesson?</td>
    <td> To code the robot arm to do what i typed.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Did I reach my target? </td>
    <td>Not fully because the robot arm did not respond but me and my partner think that it was because its battery was dead because we checked our code many times and couldn't see an error.</td>

    <td>How did you use your learning habits this week?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Persevering</td>
    <td>We looked at the book and the code we would need to type in order to make the robot arm move.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Questioning?</td>
    <td>The questions i asked myself were how are we going to spot any errors in a such a big line of code.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Independence</td>
    <td>We worked through the chapter without asking for help.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Reflecting</td>
    <td>Looking back at the work we did we could have probably worked a bit faster even though we got there in the end.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Engagement</td>
    <td>Me and partner took turns in reading the code and writing it.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What could have gone better in your learning?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>In my learning to make it better I should have probably swapped the robot arm a bit quicker rather than waste time trying to find errors in the code.</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What changes do you need to make to improve your learning next time?</td>
    <td></td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time i need to realize sooner if the reason why the robot arm isn't moving is because there's a problem with our code or because it’s the robot arm that doesn’t have batteries or because it’s broken. </td>
