  <tr>
    <td>The way i could in improve in my learning is by not asking others for help and having a bit more independence because even though i did get it right and checked it by using the book i still asked a friend to make sure that i had it correct rather than be independant and work with my partner to make sure that it was correct. But next time i will get this correct.</td>

    <td>The changes i need to make to improve my learning for next time are that i need to make sure that me and my partner follow the code very carefully and that if we do make a mistake we can clearly see what it is and how we can rectify it.</td>
